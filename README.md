WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 
All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js are used to create interactive charts for a bacteria dataset.  The table can be filtered by test subject ID from the dropdown menu located in left hand navigation menu: <a href="https://danawoodruff.github.io/plotly-challenge/">View GitHub-Page</a><br>

Once the user has selected a test subject the, at a maximum, top ten bacterium found in the test subject's bellybutton will be displayed as a bar and a bubble chart. The wash frequency is displayed as a gauge chart to allow the user to determine whether there is a correlation between bathing and bacteria volume.</p>
